## Slides

Can be found in slides.pdf

## Sections

Each section is broken down in 2 parts. The examples all start on a branch with the pattern
`sectionN-partM-start` and end on a branch with the pattern `sectionN-partM-complete`. If the
section has a hard mode, then it *may* be found on `sectionN-partM-complete-hard`.

The slides may tell you an incorrect branch or repo to use. All of the code is found in this
single repo now.
